            <p class="projects__infop">The purpose of the project is to develop a full website and local virtual library
                for Department of Accounting & Information Systems in order to showcase the overview of the department
                and create a virtual library that is only available in the departmentsâ€™ Wi-Fi network to avoid copyright
                claims. Also an optional ERP software can be used to provide accounts for individual students, faculty
                members and office staffs. All the payment, admission procedure of EMBA, event registration etc. can be
                provided using this ERP software.
                All activities related to the purpose are considered to be in scope. All activities not directly related
                to the purpose are considered to be out of scope.
                As the world is adopting cutting edge technologies, internet has become ever popular. A good website is
                now considered as the reflection of an organization. Through the website we can create virtual class
                room, take/attend online exam, showcase research & articles etc.
                The objectives of the project are given below:
                a. Provide full overview of Places People Can Visit
                b. Showcase Pictures And Experiences
                c. Proper Resource Management.
                d. Provide access to Data Stored By Users

            <p class="projects__infop">Given a snake and ladder board, find the minimum number of dice throws required
                to
                reach the destination or last cell from source or 1st cell. Basically, the player has total control over
                outcome of dice throw and wants to find out minimum number of throws required to reach last cell.
                If the player reaches a cell which is base of a ladder, the player has to climb up that ladder and if
                reaches a cell is mouth of the snake, has to go down to the tail of snake without a dice throw.
                For example, consider the board shown, the minimum number of dice throws required
                to
                reach cell 30 from cell 1 is 3.
                Following are the steps:

                a) First throw two on dice to reach cell number 3 and then ladder to reach 22
                b) Then throw 6 to reach 28.
                c) Finally through 2 to reach 30.
                There can be other solutions as well like (2, 2, 6), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 5)..
                etc.The
                idea is to consider the given snake and ladder board as a directed graph with number of vertices equal
                to
                the number of cells in the board. The problem reduces to finding the shortest path in a graph. Every
                vertex
                of the graph has an edge to next six vertices if next 6 vertices do not have a snake or ladder. If any
                of
                the next six vertices has a snake or ladder, then the edge from current vertex goes to the top of the
                ladder
                or tail of the snake. Since all edges are of equal weight, we can efficiently find shortest path using
                Breadth First Search of the graph.</p>

                The Student Attendance Management System Project In Python was developed using Python OpenCV in
                Real-Time,
                This Attendance Management System Project In Python provide a valuable attendance service for both
                teachers
                and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses
                face
                recognition technology.
                A Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition Python is a simple python script that recognizes
                faces
                and mark attendance for the recognized faces in an excel sheet. We seek to provide a valuable attendance
                service for both teachers and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable
                attendance system uses face recognition technology.
                Student Attendance Management System Features:
                Check Camera
                Capture Faces
                Train Faces
